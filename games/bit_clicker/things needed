Unlocking Prestige Button:
    The button appears only after reaching a set number of bits (e.g., 1 million).
    It resets progress but grants "prestige points" that unlock new upgrades.
    New Prestige Window:
    Clicking the button opens a new Tkinter window (Toplevel()).
    This window has prestige-specific upgrades that persist across resets.
    Prestige Effects:
    Each prestige level could give a multiplier to bits gained.
    Special permanent upgrades (e.g., auto-click speed boost, cheaper upgrades, bonus bits per click).
    Unique mechanics, like an offline earnings boost.
    Would you want the prestige points to scale exponentially (more bits = more points) or a fixed amount per reset?
